TO DO LIST:

1. Make colormapped skin support better (i.e. support radical mods like Slide, FVF, etc.)
2. Enemy skin support (helps if you are used to a certain color and have difficulty adjusting).
3. Investigate different gamma/contrast improvement options
4. Obviously the Mac build.
5. Rewrite video mode selection.
6. MH model of input possibly.
7. Proper implementation of skybox/fog
